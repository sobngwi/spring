/**

 *Verification is the process of confirming the behaviour of a Mock.
 * It is useful in determining that the class we are testing has interacted in an expected way with any of its dependencies. 
 * Sometimes we arenâ€™t interested in the values which are returned from a Mock,
 *  but are instead interested in how the class under test interacted with it, 
 *  what values were sent in or how often it was called. 
 *  The process of confirming this behaviour is <b> verification </b>
 *  and there are a number of tools which Mockito provides to allow us to do it.
 *  The verify method takes the Mock object as a parameter and returns an instance of the same Class as the Mock
